This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
npx vercel dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Live version

This project is deployed on Vercel: https://writing-challenge-game.vercel.app/

## Technologies used

`PostgreSQL` as storage for data - updates are sent just for persistence (after reload)

`Ably` as messaging (pub-sub) system - real-time updates
